# **Machine Learning & Computer Vision Projects**

This repository showcases my work on various machine learning and computer vision projects, ranging from wildlife conservation to real-time object detection.

## **Projects**

### **Project 1: Wildlife Conservation in CÃ´te d'Ivoire**
**Objective:**  
Participated in a data science competition to help scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve using machine learning.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Read and preprocess image files for machine learning.  
- Utilize **PyTorch** to manipulate tensors and build a neural network model.  
- Design and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification.  
- Use the trained model to predict animal species in new images.  
- Format predictions for submission in a data science competition.

**Objective:**  
Developed a deep learning model to classify images of crop diseases into five categories using a dataset from Uganda.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Explore and preprocess a crop disease image dataset.  
- Build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classification.  
- Improve model accuracy using **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models.  
- Identify and mitigate **model overfitting** using techniques like **data augmentation**.  
- Evaluate model performance using **k-fold cross-validation**.  
- Optimize training using **Callbacks** like Learning Rate Scheduling, Checkpointing, and Early Stopping.
